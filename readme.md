## Animal Trading Cards Project

In this Udacity project, we had to re-create a webpage from a design prototype using HTML and CSS.

Some styles I used for this project (including styles as per requirement of project) :

* italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
* removed dots for the animal's list items by adding a list-style: none attribute
* border around the animal's name, image, and information
* border around the animal's information
* added border radius
* spacing between the animal's name, image, and information
